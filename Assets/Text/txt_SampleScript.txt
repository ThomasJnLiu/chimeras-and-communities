Let’s get this bread? More like let’s make this bread!
BREAK
Mirror, mirror, on the wall, Who’s the bored-est of them all?
BREAK
I wonder if there’s anyone behind that curtain… That would make my life more interesting.
BREAK
Some people name their plants. Maybe I should name mine…
BREAK
People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing everyday.
BREAK
The sunlight looks so warm… can it warm my heart too?
BREAK
Time to stir the pot – how can I add some drama to my life today?
